# important notes

please note that like all the multimedia and bulk data processing applications, this application is computer's memory and cpu processing power dependent. as much entries exist in database, as much memory and cpu processing power the application will use when loading the entire database all nodes. but be assured you can insert thousands and thousands of entries in a single database, once the database is loaded, you can edit any entry instantly and do any operation on any node, this is normal formality mechanism in all journal and data entry applications. you can try it out and see if the application fits your needs.

# features
2 types of database used. 1. single file based database (LiteDB). 2. open windows file system based database (this is all my own invented code) in which the entire database is stored in open as ordinary files on windows and hard disk and we can read and manage any database file.

# guidance on using DiaryJournal.Net
you should frequently backup everything. you should make multiple separate and independent copies and save those copies of your database and all it's mandatory config files in different safe locations such as a safe external hard disk, usb pen drive, dvd, cd, online internet files cloud, and any other safe persistant place. this is to ensure you always have a latest saved backup copy of your journal database and all it's mandatory config files in case of anything goes wrong such as hardware or software or database failure or corruption. saving only 1 copy isn't enough. making at least 2 separate and independent copies in 2 different safe persistant easy to reach places should save your work in case of emergency. i do the same. i frequently save copies of backups of entire software and database and all mandatory files in multiple different safe places. the latest backup copy you save, everything upto the latest backup copy should be available in an emergency situation when you corrupted or lost your DiaryJournal.Net database.
