# DiaryJournal.Net
an open source and free desktop/laptop diary and journal software project from Tushar Jain, for latest Visual Studio 2022, Windows 10/11 and .Net 6.0. includes precompiled program files to use as your diary/journal application.

# version 1.8.1.0
published 21 December 2022. major upgrade. major improvements. new additions. migrated to WPF which now gives major new distinct feature additions. everything improved. i am now working for more.

# requirements
A Desktop or Laptop PC, .Net 6.0 and .Net Desktop 6.0 is the basic requirement. You need latest version of .Net 6, not the first version 6.0. You can run the executable software files in any Windows where .Net 6.0 and .Net 6.0 Desktop Runtime (both latest version not first version) properly installs and functions.

i coded the entire software on a native 64-bit Windows 11, therefore native 64-bit Windows is probably the other requirement. except for the requirements mentioned, there is no other dependency or requirement.

# important notes

you can find and use executable software files in /bin/Release/net6.0-windows/ directory.

to download the binary program/software executable files or to download the source code, you need to download both as a single zip file. please click on "Code" and then click on "Download Zip" to download both the binary program/software executable files and the source code all included into one single zip file.

DiaryJournal.Net is upgradable to .Net 7.0, so you can retarget entire DiaryJournal.Net Solution to .Net 7.0 and run DiaryJournal.Net in .Net 7.0 without issues.

if you discover a bug, defect, issue, please report it to me.
