DiaryJournal.Net can import .rtf document entries exported by the Journal 7 and 8 software. All the entries must exist in a single folder. this folder must not contain any alien or unwanted file. you should export the documents in .rtf format from the Journal software with export template format/pattern: "yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss" for example "2016-10-25-16-20-00.rtf" is the exported file name. if it is a loose-leaf entry, it shall be imported as common calendar entry in the year and month calendar nodes.

you can batch import multiple/innumerable .rtf files which were exported by any other diary/journal software, but the condition is described as follows.

batch importing "calendar" or date and time formatted .rtf entries from "The Journal 7/8" software, or any other software, 
must be formatted exactly to the regex patterns =
            // formal entry
            String pattern0 = @"(\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\d-\d\d-\d\d-\d\d)(\..*)";
            // child loose leaf entry
            String pattern1 = @"(\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\d-\d\d-\d\d)\+(.*)(\..*)";
            // formal entry with title
            String pattern2 = @"(\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\d-\d\d-\d\d-\d\d)(\s+-\s+)(.*)(\..*)";
            // formal entry with duplication index
            String pattern3 = @"(\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\d-\d\d-\d\d-\d\d)(.*)(\([0-9]+\))(.*)(\..*)";
            // child loose leaf entry multiple parent-child levels
            //String pattern4 = @"(\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\d-\d\d-\d\d)(\+)([0-9]*)(--+--)(.*)(\.[a-zA-Z].*)";
            // child loose leaf entry multiple parent-child levels delimitor --+--
            //String pattern5 = @"(\d\d\d\d--\+--\d\d--\+--\d\d--\+--\d\d--\+--\d\d)(\+)([0-9]*)(.*)(\.[a-zA-Z].*)";
            // new mode child loose leaf entry multiple parent-child levels delimiter: --+--
            String pattern4 = @"(\d\d\d\d--\+--\d\d--\+--\d\d--\+--\d\d--\+--\d\d)(.*)(\.[a-zA-Z].*)";
            // new mode child loose leaf entry multiple parent-child levels delimiter: --+--
            String pattern5 = @"(\d\d\d\d--\+--\d\d--\+--\d\d--\+--\d\d--\+--\d\d)(\+)([0-9]*)(.*)(\.[a-zA-Z].*)";

batch importing "non-calendar" or entries not formatted with date and time, from "The Journal 7/8" software, or any other software,
must be formatted with = 

        public const String defaultEntryDelimiter = @"--+--";

in both cases, entry name must be partitioned exactly as described so that it is imported in matching locations in DiaryJournal.Net Database. Non-Calendar Entries 
are partitioned with "--+--" delimiter to import all the parents and their children identified by substrings separated by "--+--" delimiter in the filename itself. 
you must ensure that no substring in any lineage level in the tree has a duplicate. all the duplicate entries are destroyed into each other by replacing 
each other while the tree is imported. so ensure no duplicate at any tree parent child level. 


'export entries to document' dialog =
1. please set the export option to .rtf in the Journal 7/8.
2. 'file names' settings:
category file name = %c

check/mark the 'include full path in loose-leaf entry names option'.
