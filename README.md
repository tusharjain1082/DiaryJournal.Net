A Desktop or Laptop PC, .Net 6.0 and .Net Desktop 6.0 is the basic requirement. You need latest version of .Net 6, not the first version 6.0. You can run the executable software files in any Windows where .Net 6.0 and .Net 6.0 Desktop Runtime (both latest version not first version) properly installs and functions.

i coded the entire software on a native 64-bit Windows 11, therefore native 64-bit Windows is probably the other requirement. except for the requirements mentioned, there is no other dependency or requirement.
