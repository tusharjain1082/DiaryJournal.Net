# DiaryJournal.Net
 an open source and free diary and journal software project from Tushar Jain, for latest Visual Studio 2022, Windows 10/11 and .Net 6.0.

# requirements
.Net 6.0 and .Net Desktop 6.0 is the basic requirement. You can run the executable software files in any Windows where .Net 6.0 and .Net 6.0 Desktop Runtime properly installs and functions.
except for the requirements mentioned, there is no other dependency or requirement. I coded the entire software on a native 64-bit Windows 11, therefore native 64-bit Windows is probably the other requirement.

# notes
you can find and use executable software files in /bin/Release/net6.0-windows/ directory.
