# important guidance for old obsolete versions 1.8.32.0 and older
please do not directly upgrade or use old versions with current version and later versions, this may corrupt the database. if you have version old 1.8.32.0 or older version, please use version 1.8.33.0 application to convert 1.8.32.0 single file database (LiteDB) into open file system db, then you will be able to migrate it into current version and later. you can find it in releases section labelled "DiaryJournal.Net6.0-v1.8.33.0". please note that LiteDB single file database engine does not allow mae to auto migrate from old versions to current version, and so database corruption may also happen.

# requirements
A Desktop or Laptop PC, .Net 8.0 and .Net Desktop 8.0 is the basic requirement. You need latest version of .Net 8, not the first version 8.0. You can run the executable software files in any Windows where .Net 8.0 and .Net 8.0 Desktop Runtime (both latest version not first version) properly installs and functions.

i coded the entire software on a native 64-bit Windows 11, therefore native 64-bit Windows is probably the other requirement. except for the requirements mentioned, there is no other dependency or requirement.

# important notes

please download the latest version package as soon as it is available, and update your application. latest version most likely contains new additions, bugs and faults fixes (important), improvements, and everything upto the version.

you can find and use executable software files in bin\Release\net8.0-windows7.0\ directory.

# features
2 types of database used. 1. single file based database (LiteDB). 2. open windows file system based database (this is all my own invented code) in which the entire database is stored in open as ordinary files on windows and hard disk and we can read and manage any database file.

# guidance on using DiaryJournal.Net
you should frequently backup everything. you should make multiple separate and independent copies and save those copies of your database and all it's mandatory config files in different safe locations such as a safe external hard disk, usb pen drive, dvd, cd, online internet files cloud, and any other safe persistant place. this is to ensure you always have a latest saved backup copy of your journal database and all it's mandatory config files in case of anything goes wrong such as hardware or software or database failure or corruption. saving only 1 copy isn't enough. making at least 2 separate and independent copies in 2 different safe persistant easy to reach places should save your work in case of emergency. i do the same. i frequently save copies of backups of entire software and database and all mandatory files in multiple different safe places. the latest backup copy you save, everything upto the latest backup copy should be available in an emergency situation when you corrupted or lost your DiaryJournal.Net database.
