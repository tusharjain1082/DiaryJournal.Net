# DiaryJournal.Net
 an open source and free desktop/laptop diary and journal software project from Tushar Jain, for desktop/laptop, latest Visual Studio 2022, Windows 10/11 and .Net 6.0 latest version.

# version 1.5.0.0
published 24 November 2022. major upgrade. major improvements. new additions. some bugs also fixed.

# requirements
A Desktop or Laptop PC, .Net 6.0 and .Net Desktop 6.0 is the basic requirement. You need latest version of .Net 6, not the first version 6.0. You can run the executable software files in any Windows where .Net 6.0 and .Net 6.0 Desktop Runtime (both latest version not first version) properly installs and functions.

i coded the entire software on a native 64-bit Windows 11, therefore native 64-bit Windows is probably the other requirement. except for the requirements mentioned, there is no other dependency or requirement.

# notes
you can find and use executable software files in /bin/Release/net6.0-windows/ directory.

to download the binary program/software executable files or to download the source code, you need to download both as a single zip file. please click on "Code" and then click on "Download Zip" to download both the binary program/software executable files and the source code all included into one single zip file.

DiaryJournal.Net is upgradable to .Net 7.0, so you can retarget entire DiaryJournal.Net Solution to .Net 7.0 and run DiaryJournal.Net in .Net 7.0 without issues.

it is very important for you to note that like all the journaling and data entry software, this software is memory dependent. because all entries/nodes configuration must be loaded in memory, not entry/node's body but configuration only, body is loaded only when the entry/node is actually selected for actual editing. the software can load and iterate more than 200,000 entries/nodes in just seconds on latest high end computers with ton of memory, but if you want to load and work with more than 200,000 entries/nodes, you need at least 16+ GB RAM and 8+ GB Windows paging file, otherwise software may fail in real time if it loads or works with workload of entries/nodes which overflows the memory. the software can load and work with even 500,000+ nodes/entries in only 16 GB RAM and 8 GB windows paging file, so it safe if you have this much memory capacity in your desktop/laptop, but if your computer is more than 10 years old and not latest technology, then the software will work darn slow. i have Core i7 8th generation desktop computer with SSD, 16 GB RAM and more than 20 GB windows paging file, so i faced simply no issue with my software DiaryJournal.Net. equal configuration you have it shall be OK, better configuration means everything better, fast, stable and safe.

as much memory and power your computer has, as much fast, capable, stable, and safe this software becomes.

if you discover a bug, defect, issue, please report it to me.

if you find this software project eligible for a star, please do star it.
